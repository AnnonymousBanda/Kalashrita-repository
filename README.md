# Kalashrita
Website for handcrafted accessories and gifts

# Detials of this project
The project is an e-commerce frontend designed as a product catalog for handcrafted gifts. The client for this repository is my elder sister, and the website includes essential sections such as 'Contact Us' and 'About Us.' Orders are managed via a 'WhatsApp' redirect feature. The website currently does not incorporate a backend system for order processing or payments. As the primary user, my sister uses the platform as a showcase for her handcrafted products, directing potential buyers to contact her via WhatsApp to place orders.
